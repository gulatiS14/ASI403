        <h1>Science Module Project</h1>

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

          <p>This project aims to develop a science module to integrate into a rover, equipping it with the capability to investigate Martian-like environments for 
            signs of life using onboard instrumentation. This module is designed to enable the rover to compete in the Science Mission of the University Rover Challenge 
            (URC).</p>

      <div id = "sub-section-1-header-1">

          <h2>1.1 University Rover Challenge</h2>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/intro_photo.png"
          subtitle="URC 2023 group photo"></image-component>

          <p>The University Rover Challenge (URC) is an international competition for college students, organized annually by the Mars Society in southern Utah, 
            USA deserts. With tasks that simulate real Martian conditions, the URC promotes the development of advanced planetary exploration technologies and 
            fosters innovation in rover design, paving the way for the next generation of Mars rovers that will support future Mars exploration.</p>

          <p>The URC consists of five sections, as outlined in the table below:</p>

          <table-component subtitle="University Rover Challenge: point breakdown">
            <div id="table-1"></div>
          </table-component>

          <p>As shown in the table, the Science Mission constitutes one-fifth of the total score in the URC competition, making it essential for us to prioritize 
            and effectively address this mission.
          </p>

          <image-component tag="image" source="assets/detailed_rubric.png"
          subtitle="Science mission rubric"></image-component>

          <p>From the science rubric, we derived the product deliverables that we should achieve by the end of the project deadline. These deliverables
            are the basis for our project scope and will guide our development process. The science mission plan that we have developed is based on this very
            deliverables.

        <h2>1.2 Project scope</h2>
        
        <p>Currently, the NUS URC Rover lacks a science module to conduct the necessary science missions required for life detection. In this mission,
          there are 5 main tasks that the rover must complete:
        </p>

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/science_mission_plan.png"
        subtitle="Science mission plan"></image-component>

        <ol>
          <li>Finding a suitable location to collect sample</li>
          <li>Navigating to the location chosen</li>
          <li>Collection of soil at minimum depth of 10cm without contamination</li>
          <li>Storing minimum of 5g of uncontaminated collected soil in a cache</li>
          <li>Using a separate 5g of uncontaminated collected soil for signs of life science experiment</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Our team aims to bridge this gap by developing a specialized science module that can interface with the existing rover and accurately 
          detect signs of life, adhering to the URC competition standards.</p>

        <p>The specific focus areas for our project scope include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Developing a science payload with protective housing that can interface with the existing rover</li>
            <li>Designing life detection experiments that can be conducted with onboard instrumentation</li>
            <li>Integrating an imaging system for panoramic and close-up documentation of geological context and sampling sites</li>
            <li>Developing environmental monitoring solutions to measure soil moisture, temperature and humidity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Value Proposition and Design Statement</h3>
        
        <p>Our science payload's value proposition extends beyond meeting URC requirements by providing key advancements in Martian astrobiology:</p>

        <ul class="value-props">
            <li><b>Improved Biosignature Detection:</b> Reduces false positives and enhances data reliability, allowing for more accurate identification of potential biosignatures.</li>
            <li><b>Advanced Molecular Analysis:</b> Enables direct detection of molecular patterns linked to biological processes, moving beyond simple organic detection.</li>
            <li><b>Setting New Standards:</b> Establishes a benchmark in life detection on Mars, informing future exploration strategies and supporting potential human missions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This value proposition emphasizes precision, innovation and reliability which adds value to both the URC and the broader field of Martian exploration.</p>

        <p>To achieve our goals, we have further subdivided the project into several topics along with assigning individual responsibilities as listed:</p>

        <p>The sub-system specific value proposition and design statement merged in one table allows our team to keep track on our own scope while still being
          able to understand the other sub-systems' scope. This will allow for better communication and understanding between the sub-systems. Organization chart also
        serves as a good reminder for one another to know how each member contributes to the final product.
