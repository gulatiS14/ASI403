    <h1>3. Electrical Sub-system</h1>

    <div id="section-header-1">
    <h2>3.1 Sub-system specific Value Proposition and Design statement</h2>
    <p> Electrical sub-system works as a supporting module to enable other science sub-systems achieve the requirements of the science mission.
      Hence, the approach for my design is to work closely with the needs of other members and their design requirements to determine my own design requirements.
    </p>

    <p><b> The 2 main value propositions that I identified are:</b></p>
    <p>
      <li> My solutions acts as a reliable instrumentation platform for all departments to use to collect samples and data.</li>
      <br>
      <li> My solutions has a modular design that functions like a platform that allows for future-proofing.</li>
     </p>

     <p><b>From these value propositions, I can derive the following design statements for my solutions:</b></p>
     <p>
      <li><b>Design statement (1):</b> Solution that collects soil moisture, temperature, and relative humidity module. [Hardware]</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Design statement (2):</b> Solution that is able to power and control science experiments. [Hardware]</li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Design statement (3):</b> Solution that provides a reliable communication channel between the main computer, sensor module, and science experiment module. [Software]</li>
     </p>
    </div>

    <div id="section-header-2">
     <h2>3.2 Concept Development</h2>
    
    <p>As for my solution, there are 2 main systems working together to achieve the science mission. 
      First is the hardware solution which will be tackling the design statement (1) and (2). 
      Second is a software solution which will be tackling the design statement (3). 
      In the following chapters, I will be going through the design process of hardware solution 
      in which the software will be delegated for future work.</p>

    <h3>Morphological chart for electronic hardware selection</h3>
    <p>I used a weighted decision matrix to determine which methods to use to fulfil the requirements of the hardware solution. A weighted decision matrix was used as not all criteria or factors are equal in importance. Additionally, instead of rank, I used a normalised score between 0 to 1 to demonstrate the magnitude of the difference in performance in the criteria of interest.</p>

    <h4>Detecting soil moisture level:</h4>
    <p>The 3 most prominent types of soil moisture sensors are Capacitive, time-domain reflectometry, and frequency-domain reflectometry sensors. From the system engineering framework, I came up with the criteria that represent:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Performance requirement (a. Accuracy)</li>
        <li>Resource constraints ( a. Cost, b. Power)</li>
        <li>Operational needs (a. Form factor, b. Maintenance)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The scores heavily favoured capacitive sensors (7.8/10) due to their optimal balance of power efficiency (9/10) and cost-effectiveness (9/10), despite lower accuracy (6/10). This scoring distribution acknowledges that for soil moisture monitoring in mobile applications, trend accuracy, and reliability outweigh absolute precision.</p>
